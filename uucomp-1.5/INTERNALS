This is the basic workflow for uucomp:

for (every argv)
do
	if not "C." file skip
	if open fail, skip
	read 1 line from C. file
	grab second and 10th field (second is data file name,
		10th is command name)
	if open fail on second field, skip
	if 10th field isn't "rmail" or "rnews", skip
	execute "gzip -9" on second field
	change "rmail" and "rnews" to "crmail" and "crnews", respectively
		in C. file
done
